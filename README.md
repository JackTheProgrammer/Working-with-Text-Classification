# NLP data classification and Analysis

In this project of mine, I have worked with textual data analysis, classification, and handling imbalance datasets using SMOTE technique for performing analysis and classification of the text data.

## Projects nature

I've done sentiment analysis/classification, spam detection of emails. The datasets are present in the repo, wither as it is or their link is provided in the notebook itself. Here're the [spam emails dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chandramoulinaidu/spam-classification-for-basic-nlp "Dataset") and [twitter sentiment analysis hate speech dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fawadawan/twitter-hate-speech-sentiment-analysis "Dataset").
